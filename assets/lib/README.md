This directory contains libraries from external projects that the template depends on. 
They are **not** under the same license as workshop-template-b code, and have their individual licenses stated in comments in the files where appropriate. 
Their licenses are compatible with workshop-template-b's aim as an open-source, non-commercial project.
If you are using the theme for another purpose, please review the licenses to ensure your use case qualifies.

They are included in this directory to ensure workshop-template-b projects can be self-contained and could be run with out connections to external dependencies or an internet connection.
