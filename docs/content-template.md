The structured data in the YAML header above will create a introduction for the entry, including the title as H1.
Add any narrative content about the project here in Markdown.

Expected contents are different depending on the section and type of content.

For items in "Models" the content should cover:

- What the project does / description
- Why the project was created
- How it uses Lib-Static approach
- Some examples if applicable
- Links to further resources or literature if applicable

For items in "Concepts" the content should cover:

- Brief summary / definition of the concept
- Why it is important to Lib-Static
- Links to further resources, tutorials, information

For items in "Community" the contents are pretty wide open!
