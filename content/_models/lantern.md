Lantern is a [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) template and toolkit for publishing [OER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) in multiple formats. 
Lantern helps you typeset OER projects with Markdown (`.md`) from common word processing formats (`.docx`) so that you can generate HTML, PDF, and EPUB versions for the public. 

All of the source control, file processing, and web hosting can be handled automatically using GitHub, or can be completed on your desktop (using Terminal, Git, and Bash).
