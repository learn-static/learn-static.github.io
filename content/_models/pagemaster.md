Pagemaster is a Ruby Gem packaged Jekyll generator plugin for creating a collection of Markdown files from a data file.

This plugin works with (and has the same requirements as ) Jekyll `>= 2.4`. It will not work directly with GitHub pages in `safe` mode. Workarounds include running locally or using GitHub Actions.
