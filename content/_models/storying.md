The site is built on a heavily customized version of CollectionBuilder, placing the collection items on a map that users can navigate by mouse or keyboard. The site features several essays and multi-modal features that are written with and through items contained in the digital collection underlying it. That collection features trailcam photographs and video, as well as oral history videos and contextual/historical images and documents.   

Uses: Jekyll; Ruby; JavaScript; JSON; Leaflet; [Tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)
