*The Digital Humanities Literacy Guidebook* is a project by Carnegie Mellon University to provide newcomers a broad understanding of the landscape of Digital Humanities.
The website was built using Jekyll, taking advantage of the potential for collaboration and long term sustainability offered by a static web approach.
Learn more about why in Matthew Lincoln's post ["Designing for preservation: static sites and the Digital Humanities Literacy Guidebook"](https://matthewlincoln.net/2019/12/19/digital-humanities-handbook.html).
