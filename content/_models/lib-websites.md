The library website is an essential piece of digital infrastructure for communication and connecting patrons to the services and resources of the library.
Rather than using the typical CMS, a lot of folks build their complete library websites using static generators. 
Most of these are unique, idiosyncratic projects reflecting their local context and contributors, highlighting the flexible solutions possible with static web approaches.

Rather than list each individual project, this post gathers together links and information about some examples.
Sites included in this list were described in Code4Lib listserve or Slack.
