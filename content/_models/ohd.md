The Oral History as Data (OHD) tool is a Jekyll template that allows users to analyze and publish coded oral history or qualitative interview files.

### Context

Oral History as Data (OHD) was initially developed by Devin Becker for use in his CTRL-Shift web project in order to visualize the coded subjects for each interview. 
It has since been more fully developed and implemented into oral history collection sites for the Voices of Gay Rodeo and Idaho Queered projects and used as the analysis tool for a qualitative study of University of Idaho researchers. 
The development of the tool has has been supported by funding from the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](http://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) and IMLS.

## How 

This tool can be used entirely through the GitHub web interface, and the generated website can be published via GitHub pages. To use the tool on a local computer, you would need to install Git, Ruby, and Jekyll.
